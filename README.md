# 📚 Unraveling the World of Books: Data Exploration with Python

This project is my first foray into **data exploration**! I worked on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, following a guided tutorial ([YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAI4ITRMkTY&list=PLTsu3dft3CWhLHbHTTzvG3Vx8XDWemG17&index=1)). This dataset contains information about books, their genres, sales, ratings, and more. 🧑‍💻  

The goal? To uncover actionable insights that publishers or book enthusiasts can use to make better decisions—like which genres to prioritize or how pricing affects sales.
